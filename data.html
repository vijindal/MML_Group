            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
                Thermodynamic modeling requires thermochemical and phase equilibrium data. However, experimental data is often limited
                 due to high costs and the challenges of studying non-stable phases, especially when developing new materials. Experimental
                  data is even more limited for multicomponent systems. In such cases, first-principles calculations, particularly those 
                  based on density functional theory (DFT), provide a reliable alternative for predicting thermodynamic properties like 
                  enthalpy and entropy as functions of temperature, volume, and pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thermochemical data, essential for modeling individual phases, is typically harder to obtain experimentally compared to
                 phase equilibrium data, which involves multiple phases and is more accessible. First-principles calculations play a vital
                  role in bridging this gap, providing much-needed thermochemical data to support CALPHAD modeling. This synergy has proven
                   particularly valuable for accurately describing binary and ternary systems and advancing the modeling of complex materials systems.

            <h3>Ordered Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Calculating the energy of an ordered structure using Density Functional Theory (DFT) is straightforward and involves several 
                well-defined steps. First, the crystal structure must be defined, including atomic positions, lattice parameters, and symmetry. 
                Input files are prepared based on the DFT software being used, such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, or CASTEP, and appropriate 
                pseudopotentials (e.g., PAW or USPP) are chosen for the elements in the system. Key computational parameters are then set, 
                including the exchange-correlation functional (commonly PBE within GGA or LDA), a k-point mesh for Brillouin zone integration 
                (e.g., Monkhorst-Pack grid), and a plane-wave energy cutoff that is typically 1.3–1.5 times the maximum recommended value in 
                the pseudopotential file. Convergence criteria for energy and forces are also defined.
            </p>

            

            <h3>Disordered Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Calculating the energy of a disordered structure using Density Functional Theory (DFT) involves additional considerations 
                compared to ordered structures, as disorder introduces complexity in representing atomic arrangements and averaging over 
                configurations. At present, there are three main approaches to calculating disordered solution phases: the coherent potential 
                approximation (CPA)) (Sigli et al. 1986), the cluster expansion (CE) (Wolverton & Zunger 1995), and the special quasirandom 
                structures (SQS)) (Wei et al. 1990) (Zunger et al. 1990) approach (Z.-K. Liu and Wang 2016). 
            </p>
           

            <h3>SQS (Special Quasirandom Structures)</h3>
            <p>
                SQS represents the best periodic supercell approximation to the true disordered state for a given number of atoms
                 per supercell (Zunger et al. 1990). SQS is optimal according to the criterion that a specified set of correlations
                  between neighboring site occupations in the SQS match the corresponding correlation of the true, fully disordered state.
                   The SQS’s for fcc-based alloys and bcc alloys have been generated by Wei et al. (Wei et al. 1990) and Jiang et al. (Jiang et al. 2004), respectively.

            <h3>Cluster Expansion (CE)</h3>
            <p>
                The cluster expansion method, introduced by Sanchez, Ducastelle, and Gratias (1984), is widely used to model configurational
                 properties by describing the energy in terms of correlation functions and effective cluster interactions (ECIs). This method 
                 provides a computationally efficient way to capture the energetics of disordered systems, especially when combined with Monte Carlo simulations.
            </p>
            <p>Any function of configuration such as the configurational enthalpy H_c for a binary phase can be expressed as a bilinear sum of the products of
                the correlation functions and their respective cluster expansion coefficients (CECs). This idea is very analogous to a Taylor or Fourier expansion.
                The function \( H_c \) can be expressed as (J. M. M. Sanchez, Ducastelle, and Gratias 1984; J. M. Sanchez 2010). 
            </p>
                <p>
                    The equation for configurational enthalpy \( H_c \) is given by:
                    \[
                    H_c = \sum_{j=1}^{r_N} C_j m_j u_j
                    \]
                </p>
            <p>Here, the subscript j is an index that serves to identify each distinct cluster type \(r_N\) is the number of all distinct cluster types, \(C_j\)  
                are the CECs and \(m_j\), the multiplicities corresponding to the respective correlation functions \(u_j\). The multiplicities \(m_j\) are defined as 
                the number of symmetry-equivalent clusters of type j per site present in the structure. 
            </p>
            <p>The expansion coefficients \(C_j\)  are also called effective cluster interactions (ECI’s), and finding their values is the central task 
                when constructing a cluster expansion. A good cluster expansion code aims to find the relevant clusters robustly. In principle, 
                the summation extends from the empty cluster containing no sites to the cluster containing all N atomic sites in the system. 
                In practice, the CECs are expected to be negligible beyond a reasonably small neighborhood.

            <h3>Application of Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Cluster expansion (CE) is commonly used to study the relationship between the enthalpy of mixing and correlation functions or 
                short-range order (SRO) parameters. However, CE must be truncated at a certain cluster size, leading to truncation errors. 
                As an alternative, a neural network is trained to model this relationship for the binary subsystems of the NbTiVZr high-entropy alloy (HEA). 
                The training involves generating a large set of structures and their corresponding correlation functions (SRO parameters) using the Alloy 
                Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT), followed by first-principles calculations to determine the enthalpy of mixing. 
                The trained neural network produces predictions that are more accurate than the CE model, offering a clearer understanding of the complex 
                relationship between the enthalpy of mixing and SRO.

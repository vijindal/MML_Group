                <p>The Heat Treatment course (MT 304) is aimed at exploring the critical processes used to modify the microstructures of metals and alloys to achieve desired mechanical properties. This course provides an in-depth understanding of structure-property correlations through various heat treatment techniques. It covers foundational topics such as the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram, isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams, and concepts like austenization, grain size, and hardenability control. The course extensively examines heat treatment techniques for ferrous alloys, including processes like quenching, annealing, normalizing, hardening, tempering, and case hardening treatments such as carburizing, nitriding, and diffusion-based surface hardening methods like laser and electron beam hardening. Additionally, it addresses heat treatment processes for non-ferrous alloys, discussing recrystallization annealing, age hardening, and heat treatments for metals such as aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel. The syllabus is designed to balance theoretical knowledge and practical industrial applications. By the end of the course, students will gain the ability to correlate heat treatment techniques to material properties, making them competent to apply these principles in both industrial and research settings. The course fosters a foundational understanding essential for engineering design and innovation in materials science.</p>

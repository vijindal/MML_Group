        <p>The Materials Modeling Lab (MML) at IIT BHU conducts advanced research in computational materials science, 
          focusing on advanced modeling techniques and innovative material design.</p>
        <p>Our research group focuses on <a href="computational_thermodynamics.html">Computational Thermodynamics</a> and 
          its applications in materials and metallurgical engineering, a vital component of Integrated Computational Materials 
          Engineering (ICME). We aim to develop accurate Gibbs energy models for solid crystalline metal phases, with particular 
          emphasis on modeling short-range ordering (SRO) effects, using advanced methods like 
          the <a href="gibbs_cvm.html">Cluster Variation Method (CVM)</a>. This work is crucial for designing advanced materials 
          such as high-entropy alloys, Ti-based composites for defense, bioimplants, and energy storage systems. Our research combines
           experimental techniques (e.g., drop calorimetry, DSC) with first-principles calculations (e.g., DFT) to 
           acquire <a href="data.html">thermochemical data</a>, and we develop <a href="https://vijindal.github.io/MML_Group/Optimization.html">CE-CVM-based algorithms</a> to 
           predict phase diagrams and optimize material properties. We also contribute to <a href="https://vijindal.github.io/MML_Group/Optimization.html">CALPHAD and CE-CVM database</a> development,
            supporting the design and processing of novel materials.</p>
                                <p>More specifically, we are interested in:</p>

                                    <li>Binary, ternary, and multicomponent transition metal systems</li>
                                    <li>Compositionally complex alloys (CCA and HEA)</li>

          <h3>Theoretical Data</h3>
          <p>In the realm of computational thermodynamics, acquiring accurate thermochemical and phase equilibrium data is paramount. 
            However, experimental data is often scarce due to the complexities and costs associated with studying unstable phases, 
            especially in multicomponent systems. To bridge this gap, our lab employs first-principles calculations, notably Density 
            Functional Theory (DFT), to predict thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy and entropy across various conditions. 
            For ordered structures, DFT calculations involve defining the crystal structure, selecting appropriate pseudopotentials, 
            and setting computational parameters like exchange-correlation functionals and k-point meshes. Disordered structures, on the
             other hand, are modeled using techniques such as Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS) and Cluster Expansion (CE). By integrating
              these computational strategies, we enhance the reliability of CALPHAD modeling, facilitating the accurate description of complex
               material systems. For more details refer to the <a href="https://vijindal.github.io/MML_Group/data.html">Theoretical Data page</a>.</p>

          <h3>Cluster Variation Method (CVM)</h3>
            <p>The Cluster Variation Method (CVM) is a statistical thermodynamics approach that enhances the modeling of Gibbs energy by explicitly 
                accounting for short-range order (SRO) in alloy systems. Unlike empirical models that represent excess Gibbs energy as polynomial 
                functions of composition without considering SRO, CVM provides a more accurate treatment by considering correlations between neighboring sites. Our
                 work enhances CVM using cluster multiplicity correction, temperature-dependent correlation functions, and a basis-independent multicomponent
                  framework for efficient thermodynamic modeling and database development. To improve the accuracy of CVM, modifications to the entropy functional 
                  have been implemented by adjusting the multiplicity of the basic cluster term. This refinement reduces truncation errors and yields better 
                  estimates of enthalpy, entropy, consolute temperature, and SRO without additional computational costs. Furthermore, to simplify the computation of 
                  correlation functions (CFs), they can be expressed as polynomial functions of composition, with coefficients being rational functions of temperature 
                  and energy parameters. This approach retains detailed information about SRO while offering computational efficiency comparable to CALPHAD techniques.

          <h3>Optimization (Thermodynamic Assessments) and Database</h3>
          <p>Our lab has developed algorithms for thermodynamic assessments, employing methods like Newton-Raphson and Levenberg–Marquardt for binary systems, 
            and adapting Hillert’s algorithm for multicomponent systems. These techniques, combined with the Cluster Expansion-Cluster Variation Method (CE-CVM), 
            enable phase equilibria calculations by accounting for short-range order. We've optimized various binary systems, and
             recently extended our work to ternary subsystems of the Nb-Ti-V-Zr system. Utilizing these assessments, we've generated thermodynamic databases for systems
              like Ti-B-Fe-Mo and Nb-Ti-V-Zr, supporting projects under DRDO-armreb and SERB, respectively. For more details refer to the <a href="https://vijindal.github.io/MML_Group/Optimization.html">Optimization page.</a></p>

            <h3>Gibbs Energy</h3>
            <p>
                The Gibbs energy can be expressed as the sum of a reference term, a mixing term, and a physical model, such as 
                one accounting for magnetic transitions. The mixing term itself comprises an ideal mixing component and an excess term. 
                Different models vary in their treatment of the excess term.
            </p>
            <p>In the first category of models, the excess Gibbs energy of mixing is represented as a polynomial function of composition. 
                These empirical models do not explicitly incorporate short-range order (SRO). In contrast, the second category of models 
                derives the excess Gibbs energy of mixing from statistical mechanics, explicitly accounting for SRO.</p>
            <p>
                The Cluster Variation Method (CVM) belongs to the second group. As a mean-field approach, CVM provides a hierarchy of solutions 
                to the Ising model, offering a reasonably accurate treatment of SRO by considering correlations between neighboring sites.
            </p>
            <h3>Modified CVM</h3>
            <p>The truncation error in the Cluster Variation Method (CVM) entropy functional can be significantly reduced by modifying the
                 multiplicity of the basic cluster term in the entropy functional. This modification is determined by equating the consolute 
                 temperature to a more accurate value. This approach improves estimates of enthalpy, entropy, consolute temperature, and 
                 short-range order (SRO) without additional computational cost, making it a practical standard for CVM entropy functionals. 
                 We have applied this methodology for bcc and fcc structures.

            <h3>Polynomial approximation of correlation function</h3>
            <p>Correlation Functions (CFs) are typically derived by solving nonlinear equilibrium equations, a process that demands 
                compute-intensive numerical methods. To simplify this, CFs can instead be expressed as polynomial functions of composition, 
                bypassing the need for equilibrium equations. In this approach, the coefficients of the polynomial are rational functions 
                of temperature and energy parameters. This method offers ease of application comparable to CALPHAD techniques while retaining
                 detailed information about short-range order (SRO). It has been successfully applied to the A2‚ÄìB32 system using the tetrahedron approximation.</p>

            <h3>Invariant Basis for Multicomponent Systems</h3>
            <p>Cluster Effective Coefficients (CECs) are not unique and exhibit basis dependence when extended from binary to multicomponent alloys. 
                Unlike CALPHAD methods, CECs lack standardization, making database development challenging. To address this issue, a new framework 
                has been developed that employs configurational variables and corresponding CECs independent of the choice of basis. This framework
                 has been validated for disordered bcc, fcc, and hcp structures, providing a standardized and reliable approach for handling CECs 
                 in complex alloy systems.</p>

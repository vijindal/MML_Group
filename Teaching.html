                <p> Computational Methods for Metallurgy course (MT 561) is intended to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary 
                    to apply numerical methods to solve problems in metallurgical engineering. The course covers a variety of topics, 
                    including error analysis, numerical differentiation and integration, root finding, optimization, and the solution 
                    of ordinary and partial differential equations. Students will also learn about finite difference and finite element 
                    methods, and how to use these methods to simulate metallurgical processes such as heat transfer, solidification, 
                    and metal forming. At the conclusion of this course, student would be able to select suitable numerical method(s)/technique(s)
                     and develop necessary computer algorithm(s) for a chosen problem. </p>

                <p>The course "Modelling and Simulation in Metallurgy" (MT 404) offers a comprehensive introduction to various modeling and simulation
                     techniques in metallurgical engineering. Topics include mathematical modeling, multi-scale modeling of materials, phase-field methods 
                     for microstructures, and simulations such as molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo techniques, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. 
                     Applications cover phase diagram computation and process modeling for blast furnaces and steelmaking. By exploring these advanced 
                     methodologies, students gain insight into supplementing experimental approaches for better understanding materials behavior.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center">Heat Treatment</h1>
                <p>The Heat Treatment course (MT 304) is aimed at exploring the critical processes used to modify the microstructures of metals and alloys to achieve desired mechanical properties. This course provides an in-depth understanding of structure-property correlations through various heat treatment techniques. It covers foundational topics such as the iron-carbon equilibrium diagram, isothermal and continuous cooling transformation diagrams, and concepts like austenization, grain size, and hardenability control. The course extensively examines heat treatment techniques for ferrous alloys, including processes like quenching, annealing, normalizing, hardening, tempering, and case hardening treatments such as carburizing, nitriding, and diffusion-based surface hardening methods like laser and electron beam hardening. Additionally, it addresses heat treatment processes for non-ferrous alloys, discussing recrystallization annealing, age hardening, and heat treatments for metals such as aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, and nickel. The syllabus is designed to balance theoretical knowledge and practical industrial applications. By the end of the course, students will gain the ability to correlate heat treatment techniques to material properties, making them competent to apply these principles in both industrial and research settings. The course fosters a foundational understanding essential for engineering design and innovation in materials science.</p>
